Presentation
============
This is a school group project at the University of Technology of Compi√®gne.
Students are asked to make up and realize a video game. Any kind, any style, it is up to us.
We decided to make our own version of the physic game "Pandemic" where humanity faces terrible diseases.

Todo
====
* Tons of stuff I haven't time to list :D Like the rules :p

* Prevent players from doing action they can't do (due to a lack of resources or wrong timing)

Reminder
========
* Ask the group to take care of the color they chose for the zone color code
