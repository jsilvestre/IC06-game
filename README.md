Presentation
============
This is a school group project at the University of Technology of CompiÃ¨gne.
Students are asked to make up and realize a video game. Any kind, any style, it is up to us.
We decided to make our own version of the physic game "Pandemic" where humanity faces terrible diseases.

Known issues
============
- the players can't easily know what zone is what color
- there is not tooltip to help players with the rules
- there is no graphics yet

- the invasion speed meter bugs when a massive invasion occurred

Probable issues
===============
- planets are attacked even if the zone's weapon has been found
